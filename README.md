### Project notes

*During the project I ran into an issue where the model would not fit to the data and found that the steps in the project were not in the correct order. I had to go off script with the help of 2 mentors and complete the project by manually encoding binary values into the data instead of usining one-hot encoding. The main project can be viewed in the "RRDinerCoffee.ipynb" notebook.*
